# Hot Gestures

Hot Gestures is a Python application that allows users to do system shortcuts like copy, cut, paste, and quit using hand gestures.

## Features

- Gesture recognition for common system actions (copy, cut, paste, quit)
- Real-time gesture recognition from the camera feed
- System interaction using keyboard shortcuts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/il-an/hot-gestures.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd hot-gestures
3. Install the required Python packages: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the main script: python main.py
2. If on macOS, allow the application to control your computer in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility and give it camera access in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Camera

Now you can use gestures(thumbs up for copy, victory for cut, thumbs down for paste and stop for quit) to interact with your system.

## Warning

The project is still in development so low-light performance is not guarenteed.
